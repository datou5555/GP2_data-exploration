# GP3_Pre-Processing
At this stage, we embed the text data using TF-IDF, a straightforward yet effective method for numerical representation. To streamline the process, we focus solely on 'rating' as the label and 'tokens' as the feature set, serving as our model's y and X, respectively. For our initial model, we employ Logistic Regression, a widely adopted and proven approach, to establish a performance baseline and evaluate accuracy.
